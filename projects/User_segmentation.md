# User Segmentation- Data Science for All Fellow

-	**Project Years:** 06/2023 to 08/2023

-	**Project Conducted as part of:** Data Science for All Correlation One Program

-	**Description of project:** 
This project aimed to perform user segmentation on Stack Overflow data to identify distinct user groups and analyze their behavior patterns. Using data from 2017-2021 from the Stack Overflow BigQuery table, we employed clustering techniques, including the Elbow and Silhouette methods, to segment users into four main groups: reputable contributors, inactive users, curious learners, and community builders. We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and retain 41% of the data variance across two principal components, which were then used to build clusters. The clustering model identified unique user behavior traits based on their contributions, participation frequency, and question/answer activity, offering insights into how these users engage with the platform.

## Technologies Used
Google Big Query, PCA, Natural Language Processing, Data Visualization, Python, R, Pandas, Clustering, Seaborn

## Project outcome: 
The project successfully identified four distinct user clusters within the Stack Overflow community, helping to distinguish high-quality contributors, infrequent users, and those active in seeking or providing knowledge. These insights can be applied to improve user engagement, inform marketing strategies, and optimize resource allocation for targeted outreach. The WordCloud generated from the "About Me" sections of users helped businesses understand user interests, such as coding and software development, which can be leveraged for targeted advertising and personalized experiences. Additionally, our analysis showed a decline in the average number of views per post since 2018, indicating a shift in platform engagement over time.

## Significance in the field of endeavor: 
This project holds significant value for businesses, tech platforms, and academic researchers. By accurately segmenting users, organizations can allocate resources more efficiently, tailor their marketing campaigns to specific user demographics, and enhance user experiences through personalization. The segmentation model also provides a deeper understanding of user engagement, helping platforms like Stack Overflow retain valuable contributors and foster community growth. These insights contribute to the broader field of data-driven user behavior analysis, enabling companies to derive actionable insights from large-scale datasets and drive innovation in customer relationship management (CRM) and user engagement strategies.
