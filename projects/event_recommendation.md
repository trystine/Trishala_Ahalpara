# Project Title: Event Recommendation System

## Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to predict event domains, types, and preferences based on previous event data and employee interests. The system enhances the recommendation experience by tailoring suggestions to individual employee preferences.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TFIDF, Random Forest Classifier
- **Tools**: Pandas, Numpy

## Purpose
This project solves the problem of event relevance by using a recommendation system that better matches users with events they are likely to be interested in.

## Key Contributions
- Designed and implemented a recommendation system that improves the relevance of event suggestions.
- Utilized TFIDF for feature extraction and a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
