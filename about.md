# About Me

Hi, I’m Trishala, a Machine Learning researcher based in California, passionate about building AI solutions that make a real-world impact.
<br><br>
My journey into AI began in Mumbai, India, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai. Fascinated by topics like Machine Learning and data-driven decision-making, I pursued a Master's degree in Applied Data Science at the University of Southern California, specializing in areas like Machine Learning for Data Science, Fairness in AI, Data Mining, and Analysis of Algorithms.
<br><br>
From DeepFake bias analysis to predictive models for student well-being, my projects combine technical innovation with ethical responsibility. My goal is to create intelligent, inclusive systems that empower individuals and organizations.
<br><br>
Beyond work, I’m a lover of solo travel, museums, and art galleries. On weekends, you’ll find me picnicking in a park or enjoying a musical. I’m also an aspiring Japanese learner and a creative soul who writes poetry and quotes.
<br><br>
As I continue to grow in Silicon Valley, I stay committed to lifelong learning, collaboration, and creating impactful solutions. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!

Regards,
<br>
Trishala Ahalpara
