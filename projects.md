# Projects

## 1. Process Mining- Longest State Prediction (Fujitsu Research of America)

- Process mining is a technique that analyzes event logs from information systems to discover, monitor, and improve real business processes by providing insights into their actual execution.

- The aim of this project is to process the raw data of incident tickets provided by Data Warehouse and create a machine learning model that can predict the longest state in which a particular incident ticket will be stuck based on the partial history 

- Project involves end to end development of data pipelines with various components. My contribution towards the project was to create the Feature Generation pipeline which focuses on feature engineering strategies of creating time-based features, statistical based features and graph-based features using networkx library.

- The outcome of the project was to have a comprehensive data processing pipeline available for the process mining data that not only joins table but also focuses on processing the data in such a way that it is ready to be utilized by the machine learning model to predict the longest state in which the incident ticket will be stuck based on the partial history of the incidents.

- Collaborated in developement of teh Automated Pipeline and submitted a patent for the same.

## 2. Process Mining- Burst Detection on Insights (Fujitsu Research of America)

- This project is focused on building an Analysis and Predictive Tool powered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning research for the Business Processes.
- There are some key challenges faced by the team regarding Incident ticket analysis and Conformance Checking. The need to have a tool which can help Troubleshoot what went wrong in a process cycle and identify the pain areas is one of the avenues where the project is focused on.
- My contribution towards this project was to research and implement how we can utilize the Fujitsuâ€™s in-house proprietary technology on the Process Mining data. To generate insights such as what kind of feature combinations and values contributes towards a non-conforming or conforming Incidents. Identifying these pain areas can help Operation Managers to focus on only those features that are causing the issue.
- Further Application of Burst Detection Algorithm to find important trends and patterns is one of the research areas I am currently focusing on.

## 3. User Segmentation- Data Science for All Fellowship

- This project aimed to perform user segmentation on Stack Overflow data to identify distinct user groups and analyze their behavior patterns. Using data from 2017-2021 from the Stack Overflow BigQuery table, we employed clustering techniques, including the Elbow and Silhouette methods, to segment users into four main groups: reputable contributors, inactive users, curious learners, and community builders. We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and retain 41% of the data variance across two principal components, which were then used to build clusters. The clustering model identified unique user behavior traits based on their contributions, participation frequency, and question/answer activity, offering insights into how these users engage with the platform.

## 1. Event Recommendation System 
A system that recommends events to employees based on their preferences and past activity using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

Key Technologies: Natural Language Processing, Random Forest Classifier, TFIDF

Description: The system uses event data and employee entries to predict event types, domains, and preferences. The goal is to help organizations match employees to events that align with their interests.
